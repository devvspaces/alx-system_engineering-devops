# Web Stack Debugging

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors within a script. It involves a systematic process of testing, identifying, and reducing bugs in a computer program or a piece of electronic hardware, thus enabling it to behave as expected. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.
